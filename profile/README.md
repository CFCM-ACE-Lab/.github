# Welcome to ACE-Lab

### Part of the Centre for Future Clean Mobility (CFCM) at the University of Exeter

Welcome to the GitHub organisation for the **AI-enabled Co-Design in Engineering Laboratory (ACE-Lab)**, part of the **Centre for Future Clean Mobility (CFCM)** at the **University of Exeter**. This organisation serves as the primary platform for hosting and managing the code, tools, and resources developed by ACE-Lab to support our innovative work in digital engineering and clean mobility solutions.

## About ACE-Lab

The ACE-Lab is a cutting-edge facility within CFCM, a leading research centre at the University of Exeter. Funded by the **Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)**, our focus is on leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance the co-design process in engineering, driving forward the development of clean mobility technologies.

### Key Features:

- **AI-Driven Engineering**: We integrate advanced AI and machine learning methods to optimise the design, simulation, and operation of clean mobility solutions.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: We foster an environment where AI tools and human expertise work together to create innovative, efficient, and sustainable engineering solutions.
- **Industry Partnerships**: We actively collaborate with SMEs in the South West region, offering expertise and resources to tackle complex engineering challenges.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Our lab is equipped with powerful computational resources, virtual and augmented reality tools, 3D sensing, and industrial engineering hardware.

## Mission Statement

ACE-Lab is dedicated to transforming the landscape of clean mobility through the application of AI and machine learning. Our goal is to combine cutting-edge technology with human insight to develop solutions that are both sustainable and forward-thinking, addressing the future needs of the mobility industry.

## Our Work

At ACE-Lab, we focus on a range of projects that involve:

- **Modelling and Simulation**: Creating digital twins and simulations for individual transport assets such as vessels, vehicles, and fleets.
- **Optimisation**: Utilising AI-driven optimisation techniques to improve the performance and sustainability of clean mobility solutions.
- **Collaborative Research**: Partnering with industry stakeholders to address real-world engineering problems, contributing to regional economic growth and technological advancement.
